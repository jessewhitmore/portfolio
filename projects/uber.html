          <div class = "SUBHEADER">The Problem</div>
          <p>In the ever-evolving landscape of ride-sharing, Uber faced the challenge of ensuring that its core value of speed and reliability remained at the forefront of consumer consciousness. While the brand was synonymous with convenient transportation, the rapid expansion of the industry meant that competitors were vying for the attention of the same consumer base.</p>
          <p>As a result, Uber needed a strategic campaign to not only remind users of its unparalleled speed and reliability but also to carve a distinctive space in the minds of consumers amid the growing noise of competitors. It wasn’t merely about promoting a service; it was about reminding the audience of why Uber was the only reliable go-to choice for swift and dependable rides.</p>
          <div class = "SUBHEADER">The Investigation</div>
          <p>Delving into Uber’s API, we knew we were able to ping the real-time ETA for a geo-location. Every panel within the JCDecaux inventory has a geo-location within the specs database, this became a canvas for the idea of leveraging digital screens to show real-time ETA. This idea was simple, digestible, and got to the heart of Uber’s key requirements. We built out a presentation deck communicating this proposition winning the brief.</p>
          <div class = "SUBHEADER">The Development</div>
          <p>Collaborating closely with developers, we used websockets solutions discovered with the Amazon Black Friday campaign to craft a seamless solution, where the panel loaded with the Live ETA of the nearest Uber. To ensure a consistently dynamic display, the received value was stored and updated every minute. In case of outdated information or an ETA exceeding 8 minutes, a fail-safe default message stepped in ensuring the client chief message was always respected.</p>
          <div class = "SUBHEADER">The Solution</div>
          <p>Executed across digital screens in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane the campaign married Uber’s cutting-edge digital app with the timeless impact of Out-of-home advertising. The integration not only showcased our ability to blend modern with traditional medium but also left our client satisfied with the campaign. I’m particularly proud of fighting against overly highlighting the dynamic element, so often people feel a need to point out the obvious fact that an element of the advertisement has been localised. The feat of localisation often has immense work to get right and consistent – however – just like a good audio technician should be invisible so should the work of those behind the scene to deliver a campaign. Sometimes making the complex seem overly simple makes for a more impactful message.</p>
