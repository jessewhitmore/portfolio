          <div class = "SUBHEADER">The Problem</div>
          <p>In a bid to elevate the excitement around its premium F1 experience, Heineken embarked on a dynamic campaign designed to engage the public and amplify its brand presence. Leveraging the appeal of television personality Olena from “The Bachelor,” the goal was to leverage this unique interaction with the audience and the tantalising exclusive giveaway to strength positive brand image.</p>
          <div class = "SUBHEADER">The Investigation</div>
          <p>Pooling together our expertise in medium, technology, engineering, with JCDecaux premium inventory placement, our team convened to brainstorm innovative ways to meet the client’s ambitious campaign goals. While brainstorming, the proposal of an interactive live cross featuring the charismatic personality as a discerning “bouncer,” tasked with selecting the contender that impresses her to win the coveted tickets was theorised.</p>
          <p>This idea seemed to all to be a winner. We worked to put together a compelling deck for the sales presentation, accompanied by vivid mock-up visualising how it could look, this concept we felt created a fusion of technology, engagement, and brand allure, promising a memorable experience for participants and allowing for an impactful promotional vehicle for Heineken that only JCDecaux could provide.</p>
          The Development</div>
          <p>Collaborating closely with our external providers, I played a pivotal role in articulating the project details, coordinating with printers, ensuring engineering tasks were proceeding to client needs, and ensuring the seamless orchestration of all elements met the stringent deadline requirements. As the project transitioned into its operational phase, I took on additional responsibilities of a technical officer, personally overseeing the intricacies of panel instalation, ensuring install and testing were done correctly for this campaign. This hands-on involvement reflected my commitment to ensuring the end product regardless of what scope it falls in.</p>
          <div class = "SUBHEADER">The Solution</div>
          <p>The ultimate deployment strategy involved strategically placing these interactive panels across key high-traffic locations within the JCDecaux network throughout Australia. Each panel was equipped with an integrated screen, webcam, microphone, speaker, and a dispenser. Leveraging a custom web applet, we orchestrated a countdown to all live crosses, to elicit curiosity and build anticipation. The custom applet facilitated a live cross between panel and studio, and allowed for sound effects and dispensing of drink tickets at the press of a button. This interaction allowed for the creation of hilarious and quirky moments as the public tried to impress our talent. All of this was captured for promotional video uses linked here-in. This creative solution not only met Heineken’s campaign objective but also delivered an immersive and memorable experience to the audience.</p>
