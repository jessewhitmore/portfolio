          <p>My journey at Playground commenced in the role of Creative Technologist, a position that laid the foundation for my understanding of the team’s workload and requirements. This experience was invaluable as it provided me with complete competency in navigating the challenges of the creative process within the company.</p>
          
          <p>Here, I present a selection of builds that I created during my tenure in this role. It’s crucial to note that each build represented one of numerous projects-sometimes up to six — conceived, designed, and coded within a single day, often without pre-existing assets. This dynamic environment sharpened my ability to work swiftly and effectively, strategically applying polish where it mattered most. The role also presented numerous opportunities for experimentation, allowing me to continually push the limits of what I deemed possible.</p>
          
          <p>See below a selection of builds I am most proud of, you can click on the phone to launch the experience in a new tab. The preview gif doesn’t exactly do justice to work done:</p>
