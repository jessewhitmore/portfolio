          <div class = "subHeader">The Problem</div>
          <p>Rapid growth and increased service demands at Playground spurred by the pandemic created challenges for the design team’s efficiency and work life balance. Recognising the issue, I took the initiative to investigate and formulate a comprehensive solution. This involved streamlining procedures, adjusting policies, leveraging technology, and proposing staffing changes. The result was a strategic pitch presented to stakeholders for approval.</p>
          <div class = "subHeader">The Investigation</div>
          <p>Understanding Playground’s emphasis on visual sales, I approached the proposal for structural and procedural changes with a recognition that complex mapping could be perceived as dry. In response, I prioritised creating a compelling visual narrative during the development phase. This ensured the proposed changes were not only strategically sound but presented in a visually engaging manner to maximise buy-in.</p>
          <div class = "subHeader">The Development</div>
          <p>Initiating the development phase, I crafted a compelling narrative centred on frontier living as the shell around which I would build. A choice I felt would resonate with the company’s founders. This narrative had a dual significance: a) it aligned with the CEO’s recent excursions into the American market, and b) it symbolised the transformative growth within the company and the need to change from a start-up to an established company. This theme seamlessly emphasised the need for modernisation, shedding light on the outdated methods that were no longer serving the company’s evolving needs.</p>
          <p>With this narrative shell in place, I could then build out the dryer content with this in mind. I addressed business cases, charters, and procedural changes needed to alleviate departmental pain points. Solutions included establishing rules for engagement beyond service limits, stack upgrades for improved turnaround times, reskilling of internal staff, and enhanced reporting mechanism for informed decision-making.</p>
          <p>After formulating the logical framework and the path forward, my focus shifted to transforming it into a compelling narrative. I organised the projects into city districts, with each building being a sub-project employing a colour-coded system to delineate each sub-project by type. This approach allowed for visually engaging presentations where each district could be explored in detail, offering a deep dive into the nuts and bolts of how each project would be achieved.</p>
          <div class = "subHeader">The Conclusion</div>
          <p>Following comprehensive buy-in and enthusiastic support from major stakeholders, the implementation phase of the plans commenced. The results were transformative, leading to significant enhancements in team output and satisfaction. Notably, the team successfully met high-pressure, industry-leading deadlines. The technical stack saw substantial improvements, including updates to the video library, format refactoring, animation library enhancements, and the establishment of tracking standards previously not present. Some of these projects will be covered in other sections of this site!</p>
