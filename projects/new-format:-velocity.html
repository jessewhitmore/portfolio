          <div class = "SUBHEADER">The Problem</div>
          <p>Upon the initiation of paperwork for the acquisition of Playground (PXYZ), I was entrusted with the critical task of crafting a format that strategically capitalised on PXYZ’s focus on attention and captivating bespoke Ads while aligning seamlessly with GumGum’s existing footprint. The challenge at hand involved defining a format design that not only embodies the essence of attention-centric content but also presents a fresh and captivating proposition for the sales team, enhancing their sales strategies.</p>
          <div class = "SUBHEADER">The Investigation</div>
          <p>Embarking on the concept and ideation phase, I conducted a thorough competitive analysis, scrutinising both external and internal formats within the industry. This exploration aimed to uncover the strengths and weaknesses of similar products in the market, providing valuable insights for our upcoming creation. These strengths and weaknesses as well as unique selling points, particularly within internal products, served as a foundational guide for improvements and areas not requiring development since they were covered by other products.</p>
          <p>Defining the format’s identity became a pivotal aspect, classifying core, peripheral, and tertiary elements to establish a distinct flavour and identity for the product. To achieve this, a 2x2 matrix was created, evaluating the value-to-cost ratio of features and technology desired within the product. Multiple rounds of user stories were meticulously crafted, encompassing perspectives from sales, operations, product, supply, and design. These stories were grouped into themes, ensuring comprehensive coverage of key users' needs while creating an understanding where features and technology would benefit the most users.</p>
          <p>To break down the format into a structured anatomy – core features, visual elements, and utilised foundational architecture were identified. This systematic approach aimed to create a product that addressed the needs of all stakeholders, with a clear understanding of limitations to ensure the feasibility of the envisioned product. Collaborating with my lead developer, we identified velocity as a unique and playful feature that could distinguish the format. Recognising the innate human tendency to be drawn to movement conveying weight, tapping into humans' instinct for camouflage recognition, and then engaged with relief playfulness when no threat is identified. This is a powerful way to incorporate engagement and play. This design decision not only aligned with the attention grabbing requirements set by the existing leading format, hangTime, but also introduced a unique and engaging aspect to the new format. A win-win for sales strategies.</p>
          <div class = "SUBHEADER">The Development</div>
          <p>The development phase involved a collaborative effort to determine the optimal launch strategy from an underutilised 320x50 placement, an underutilised placement already on our purchase sheet allowing for the format to help with supply issues and minimise competition with other leading format HangTime on placement bidding. I played a key role in ensuring this placement adhered to best standards, and participated in negotiations to maximise the format for sales while ensuring supply had an easier time convincing publishers to integrate the format. Each publisher often needs some modification work to ensure the format launches without interruption of the existing site. I took the initiative to ensure my lead developer was free to focus on more pressing matters by handling this task on his behalf. With extensive testing among key user groups refinements on the feel and look were done. I feel like a part of this testing not only ensures the product is on track but ensures that the key users feel like a part of the creation process and are more likely to support and adopt the product come launch. An important feedback loop was the design team who would be required to push out complex execution day one with an unfamiliar product. I knew that their comfort and pain points were key to make or break for this product so I spent large amounts of effort to make their interaction with the product as straightforward with clear parallel with existing formats and the maximum ability to flex the format so new and better workflows and techniques could emerge within this product.</p>
          <p>As the product foundation became settled I began to craft examples showcasing how the unique selling point of the format – velocity – could be leveraged for ad builds, establishing a standard for optimal use and generating excitement for the coming product. Collaborating with the designers, I created several code templates and PSDs giving yet another tool in the arsenal of the team to make exceptional work from day one of launch. Additionally, the development phase included the creation of marketing material and collateral, providing comprehensive support for the sales team post live date.</p>
          <div class = "SUBHEADER">The Conclusion</div>
          <p>The culmination of the development efforts resulted in the creation of a series of blank and templated executions tailored for the design team’s and external designers' use. Additionally, a comprehensive package of marketing collateral was created to empower the sales team with an impressive site list of bought in publishers. All metric seemed to meet or beat that of other formats, it performed so well that the data team felt it maybe issues with how they were collecting data – the data team are never shy to expect the worse. The solution included clear guidance on the next steps for the official deployment onto the site. At the time of my departure from the company, the product was ready for internal requests but had not yet been officially launched on the public facing site. The pending release awaits further mergers and the introduction of a new universal studio tool, which will serve both GumGum and PXYZ designers allowing the format to be globally used through the company.</p>
