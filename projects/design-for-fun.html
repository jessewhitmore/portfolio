          <div class = "HEADER">Design for fun</div>
          <p>Sometimes I make things that don’t need to be deep dived. Sometimes it’s about pure enjoyment and expression rather than solving a specific problem. This collection showcases a series of projects undertaken for the sheer joy of design, often for informal or unofficial events or products. Sometimes they are done as favours or outside of my normal wheel house as an interesting professional challenge. Here lies a catalogue of these projects for prosperity:</p>
          <div class = "SUBHEADER">Casino Fiesta</div>
          <p>Casino Fiesta was part of games night, a quarterly event run by PXYZ to engage employees and create a fun environment. Having just started I wanted to help make it the best it could be. Features is a video I made in After Effects which was paired with decorations and stage lighting to create a memorable event that is still spoken about till today at the company. So clearly I’m fun at organising parties.</p>
          <div class = "SUBHEADER">PIT card game redesign</div>
          <p>I am an advert board game fan and PIT was a classic among my friend group. I always felt that PIT artwork was dated and lacking so I wanted to make something that matched the stock market feel by making an art deco version with striking art that instantly made the cards recognisable. I specifically chose bigger than normal cards for the game to add an added element of frantic dexterity. All in all with the limited colour palette I’m super happy with the end result.</p>
          <div class = "SUBHEADER">English Unlimited young adults</div>
          <p>An old alumni of mine is the Director of English Unlimited and wanted to create an engaging educational book for young adults learning English with a real Australiana feel as most clients who enrol do so to learn English within an Australian culture. He asked me if I’d be willing to design it, the brief was big splashy pages of full illustration. I took on the job as both a favour as he can be a fussy client and as a bit of fun doing a different type of illustration.</p>
